    "text": "Single-cell RNA-seq analysis is a powerful technique used in biology and medicine to study the gene expression of individual cells within a population. Single-cell gene expression analysis and bulk RNA-seq differ primarily in the scale and resolution of the analysis. Single-cell gene expression analysis focuses on individual cells, providing insights into cellular heterogeneity and rare cell populations. In contrast, bulk RNA-seq measures the average gene expression of a population of cells, masking cellular diversity. Single-cell analysis requires specialized methods to isolate and analyze individual cells, while bulk RNA-seq is more straightforward and commonly used for analyzing gene expression in larger cell populations.\nBesides producing beautiful visualizations (La Manno et al. 2021), single-cell data has revolutionized the information regarding cell biology, with direct applications to the understanding of cell development and human diseases.\n\n\n\nt-SNE representation for cell types development in mouse brain.
