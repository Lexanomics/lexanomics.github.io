    "title": "Jumping genetic element getting in the way of primates tail evolution",
    "section": "",
    "text": "It is of common knowledge that humans and monkeys share great similarities regarding their genomes. And, if most monkeys have tails, what happend to ours? This is the central question Xia and colleagues (Xia et al. 2024) try to answer.\nAfter comparing the genomic sequences across primates, the researchers found a mobile genetic element called Alu only inserted on the gene TBXT of apes, a gene that encodes for a transcription factor associated with tail development in mammals. Alu elements have the ability of ‚Äúteleporting‚Äù and fixating in other genome regions and therefore they are very important to diversify genome sequences. The Alu element insertion found in apes leads to an alternative splicing event, resulting in the production of a shortened form of the TBXT gene. Humans express both the full-length and the shortened versions of TBXT gene.\n\n\n\nEvolution of tails in primates. Figure from Xia et al, 2024.\n\n\nTo test their hypothesis, researchers engineered mice to express these two gene versions and they observed that, in this scenario, mice exhibit a lack of a tail or a shortened tail, similar to the tail-loss phenotype in hominoids. However, for mice engineered to have only the shortened version of TBXT gene died during the embryonic development. This suggests that the evolution of tail loss in hominoids may have been associated with an adaptive trade-off, where the loss of the tail conferred evolutionary advantages but also increased the risk of neural tube defects.\n\n\n\nFrom SMBC comics (https://www.smbc-comics.com/).\n\n\nThis research is a great example of comparative genome analysis, common in the Bioinformatics area.

Also, with DNA sequencing, it is possible to identify microorganisms in environmental samples, such as soil or water, helps monitor biodiversity, identify species presence, and assess ecosystem health;\nü¶¥ Evolutionary Biology: Sequencing the genome of viruses and bacteria allows us to develop more precise hypotheses regarding the spread of pathogens responsible for the development of infectious diseases. Also sequencing ancient DNA from fossils and archaeological remains contributes to our understanding of evolutionary processes and the history of life on Earth.\nThe Lexanomics team is experienced in all DNA sequencing analyses.

    "section": "",
    "text": "Single-cell RNA-seq analysis is a powerful technique used in biology and medicine to study the gene expression of individual cells within a population. Single-cell gene expression analysis and bulk RNA-seq differ primarily in the scale and resolution of the analysis. Single-cell gene expression analysis focuses on individual cells, providing insights into cellular heterogeneity and rare cell populations. In contrast, bulk RNA-seq measures the average gene expression of a population of cells, masking cellular diversity. Single-cell analysis requires specialized methods to isolate and analyze individual cells, while bulk RNA-seq is more straightforward and commonly used for analyzing gene expression in larger cell populations.\nBesides producing beautiful visualizations (La Manno et al. 2021), single-cell data has revolutionized the information regarding cell biology, with direct applications to the understanding of cell development and human diseases.\n\n\n\nt-SNE representation for cell types development in mouse brain.
