    "title": "Jumping genetic element getting in the way of primates tail evolution",
    "section": "",
    "text": "It is of common knowledge that humans and monkeys share great similarities regarding their genomes. And, if most monkeys have tails, what happend to ours? This is the central question Xia and colleagues (Xia et al. 2024) try to answer.\nAfter comparing the genomic sequences across primates, the researchers found a mobile genetic element called Alu only inserted on the gene TBXT of apes, a gene that encodes for a transcription factor associated with tail development in mammals. Alu elements have the ability of “teleporting” and fixating in other genome regions and therefore they are very important to diversify genome sequences. The Alu element insertion found in apes leads to an alternative splicing event, resulting in the production of a shortened form of the TBXT gene. Humans express both the full-length and the shortened versions of TBXT gene.\n\n\n\nEvolution of tails in primates. Figure from Xia et al, 2024.\n\n\nTo test their hypothesis, researchers engineered mice to express these two gene versions and they observed that, in this scenario, mice exhibit a lack of a tail or a shortened tail, similar to the tail-loss phenotype in hominoids. However, for mice engineered to have only the shortened version of TBXT gene died during the embryonic development. This suggests that the evolution of tail loss in hominoids may have been associated with an adaptive trade-off, where the loss of the tail conferred evolutionary advantages but also increased the risk of neural tube defects.\n\n\n\nFrom SMBC comics (https://www.smbc-comics.com/).\n\n\nThis research is a great example of comparative genome analysis, common in the Bioinformatics area.

    "section": "",
    "text": "Have you ever heard that a great percentage of our body composition comes from the microorganisms living with us? Recent research suggests a 1:1 ratio for the number of microorganisms and human cells in the body (Sender, Fuchs, and Milo 2016). We coexist with several species of microorganisms and, therefore, our physiology is greatly influenced by these tiny beings. But can we study them all at once?\n\n\n\nDesigned by Freepik\n\n\nYes! That’s when metagenomics comes to the rescue! Metagenomics is a relatively recent field of study within genetics and microbiology that involves the analysis of genetic material collected directly from human or environmental samples. The key principle behind metagenomics is the sequencing and analysis of DNA or RNA from an entire microbial community, without the need for isolating and culturing individual organisms. Here’s some applications for metagenomics:\nHuman Microbiome Research: 👩‍🔬 Metagenomics sheds light on the diverse microbial communities residing within us, influencing health, disease, and personalized medicine;\nClinical Diagnostics: 🏥 Rapid identification of pathogens in clinical samples aids in disease diagnosis, treatment, and surveillance, bolstering public health efforts;\nBiodiversity Conservation: 🦠Assess microbial diversity in threatened habitats, aiding in conservation planning and restoration efforts;\nEnsuring Food Safety: 🍽️ Detect foodborne pathogens, spoilage organisms, and authenticate food products, ensuring safety and quality;\nForensic Analysis: 🕵️‍♂️ Analyze microbial signatures associated with crime scenes, human remains, and environmental samples, enhancing forensic science capabilities;\nEnvironmental Microbiology: 🌍 Metagenomics unveils insights into ecosystems, aiding conservation efforts and sustainable resource management;\nBioremediation Solutions: 🛠️ Metagenomics identifies microbial candidates capable of degrading pollutants, paving the way for effective bioremediation strategies;\nAdvancing Agriculture: 🌾 Metagenomics guides precision farming practices, enhancing crop productivity, and fostering sustainable agriculture…\n… and many more!

    "text": "The year 2020 will forever be remembered as the starting point of the COVID-19 pandemic, declared by the World Health Organization. A revolution in the speed of information generation marked this period, especially concerning the characterization of SARS-CoV-2 and the understanding of COVID-19.\n\n\n\nDesigned by Freepik\n\n\nIn just 12 days, from the hospital admission of a patient with characteristic COVID-19 symptoms to the publication in the prestigious journal Nature, the process of characterizing SARS-CoV-2 was remarkably efficient. In the study titled A New Coronavirus Associated with Human Respiratory Disease in China by Wu and collaborators (Wu et al. 2020), an advanced analytical method took center stage: meta-transcriptomics.\nTo better comprehend the pathogen infecting the patient, researchers employed high-coverage meta-transcriptomic sequencing through the Illumina MiniSeq platform. The biological sample from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid underwent de novo contig assembly, revealing a 30,474-nucleotide sequence closely related to the SARS-like coronavirus genome found in bats (CoV) and recorded in the GenBank.\nThe identified virus was named WH-Human 1 coronavirus (WHCV). Analysis of the viral sequence not only allowed for the inference of the transmission route but also uncovered mutations in the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the SPIKE protein. This mutation was crucial, enabling the viral lineage to bind to the ACE2 protein and thus infect human cells. Additionally, the research traced the evolutionary events that gave rise to the virus later known as SARS-CoV-2.\nThis study stands as a remarkable example of how contemporary sequencing techniques, combined with careful analysis of biological data tools, play a vital role in the early detection of pathogens and the timely identification of agents capable of triggering local or global outbreaks.\nStay updated on metatranscriptomics, metagenomics, NGS, pathogens, virus, and COVID-19, and discover how science is unveiling the secrets behind global health threats.\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nWu, F., S.

    "section": "",
    "text": "Single-cell RNA-seq analysis is a powerful technique used in biology and medicine to study the gene expression of individual cells within a population. Single-cell gene expression analysis and bulk RNA-seq differ primarily in the scale and resolution of the analysis. Single-cell gene expression analysis focuses on individual cells, providing insights into cellular heterogeneity and rare cell populations. In contrast, bulk RNA-seq measures the average gene expression of a population of cells, masking cellular diversity. Single-cell analysis requires specialized methods to isolate and analyze individual cells, while bulk RNA-seq is more straightforward and commonly used for analyzing gene expression in larger cell populations.\nBesides producing beautiful visualizations (La Manno et al. 2021), single-cell data has revolutionized the information regarding cell biology, with direct applications to the understanding of cell development and human diseases.\n\n\n\nt-SNE representation for cell types development in mouse brain.
